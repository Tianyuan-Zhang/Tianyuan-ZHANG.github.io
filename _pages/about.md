Hello! I am an assistant professor of data science and business analytics at KEDGE Business School.

Research Interest
------
My research focuses on data-driven decision making under uncertainty. I seek to provide both methodologies and practical solutions that combine tools and concepts from machine learning, operations research, and geoinformatics. From an application perspective, my research focuses on supply chain management and logistics.

- Decision-focused learning
- Predictive & prescriptive analytics
- Supply chain management
- Geoinformatics
- Simulation
